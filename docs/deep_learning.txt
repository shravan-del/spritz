Deep Learning is a subset of machine learning based on artificial neural networks. These networks are inspired by the human brain's structure and function.

Key concepts in deep learning:
1. Neural Networks: Layers of interconnected nodes that process information
2. Backpropagation: Algorithm for training neural networks
3. Activation Functions: Functions that determine neuron output
4. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN): Specialized for processing grid-like data
5. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN): Designed for sequential data processing

Applications of deep learning:
- Image Recognition: Identifying objects and faces in images
- Speech Recognition: Converting spoken language to text
- Language Translation: Translating between different languages
- Game Playing: Mastering complex games like Go and Chess
- Drug Discovery: Predicting molecular properties and interactions
